% NOTES:

% This sample bibliography contains the top 20 from Neal Caren's list of the 102 most cited works in the field of Sociology for the years 2008-2012, which can be found here: https://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/the-102-most-cited-works-in-sociology-2008-2012/

% bader2007 is included only as an example of a 3 author paper,
% to check if a comma is included before the "and" in the references.

% Depending on the style used, some manual editing of this
% .bib file, or the original entries in Zotero is necessary.
% For example, AJS requires full author names (not initals), and
% prefers web pages be referenced in footnotes, not in the bibliography.
% AJS also prefers headline style capitalization (All Words Except
% Articles like a, and an)

	abstract = {The Baylor Religion Survey ({BRS}) is a national population survey of religious characteristics, orientations, and attitudes modeled after the General Social Survey. This article provides an overview of the content of the 2005 {BRS} along with a detailed description of our methods of data collection and some descriptive characteristics from our sample of 1,721 adults in the United States. A third of the survey is dedicated solely to religion items focusing on affiliation, identity, belief, experience, and commitment. Two-thirds of the survey is dedicated to topical modules that will be rotated in subsequent administrations. We briefly describe the content of these modules and discuss how our data compare to the 2004 General Social Survey.},
