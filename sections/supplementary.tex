    \textbf{Comparison of various denoising and clustering algorithms used in the pipeline}.
    (A, B) Correlation ofjk the abundances of the taxa that are in common between the count matrices created by two different methods.
    (A) The best correlation (most similar methods) is between open-reference and denovo.
    (B) The worst correlation (least similar methods) is between open-reference and dada2.
    (C) A heatmap showing the $\mathrm{R}^2$ of all pairwise comparisons of the methods.

      (A) weighted unifrac distances and (B) unweighted unifrac distances between the representative sequences generated by different denoising and clustering algorithms.
      These results are in agreement with the stool microbiome dataset.
