1. We have updated Figure 5 to include both precision and sensitivity values. This allows the reader to understand the tradeoff between the precision and sensitivity that the consensus algorithms make in order to maximize precision.
2. We have processed an additional dataset (stool samples from radiation-exposed bank vole) through the micone pipeline and performed network variance analysis to evaluate the consistency of the effects of workflow steps on the inferred networks. We show that network variance is fairly consisten across the different datasets (Figure S8 and corresponding supplementary text).
3. Reason for not analyzing/comparing with interaction data - Given that the relationship between microbial interactions and co-occurrences is still poorly understood and highly debated (Fisher & Mehta, 2014), we would rather keep this manuscript about co-occurrences without addressing this topic, which would entail a whole new type of analysis and scope. However, we embraced the reviewer's comment about demonstrating our pipeline on an additional dataset.
